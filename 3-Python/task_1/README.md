# Task 1

## Self-study input() function
  
  > Write a script which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers and prints these objects 
  as-is (just print(list) without any formatting).
  
 input() function returns string value.
 
 Here is list comprehension used to create a list and tuple from array of comma-separated strings produced by *input_str.split(',')*.
 These small strings are converted into float number type (so they are countable).
