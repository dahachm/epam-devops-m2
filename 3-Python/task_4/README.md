# Task 4

> Write a small script which will print a string using all the types 
> of string formatting which were considered during the lecture with the following context: 
>
> **"This script has the following PID: <ACTUAL_PID_HERE>. 
> It was ran by <ACTUAL_USERNAME_HERE> to work happily on <ACTUAL_OS_NAME>-<ACTUAL_OS_RELEASE>."**

This script prints message using 3 string formatting types:
  1. Using **str.format()** method. By using *{}* it's possible to point the place *str*, where variables must be substituted.
  2. Using **f-string** (*f''*). Also use *{}* to point place of variable's substitution.
  3. Using **string modulo operator(%)**

## Examples:
